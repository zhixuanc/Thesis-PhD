\Appendix{Approximate riemann solvers}
\label{app:RP-solvers} 

The starred variable $p^{\ast}$ and $u^{\ast}$ in discretized governing equation of GSPH and RSPH represent the interpolated pressure and velocity at certain point (an imaginary interface in GSPH or a randomly sampled poit in RSPH) along the line joining the pairs of two particles. They do not have to be obtained by solving a Riemann problem. However, $p^{\ast}$ and $u^{\ast}$ obtained by solving a Riemann problem provides necessary and sufficient dissipation needed to capture discontinuities and stabilize the scheme. 
The exact Riemann solver, even though more accurate and robust, requires an iterative root finding, and hence is computational inefficient. For governing equations other than well-studied ones, such as Euler equations, there is no iterative Riemann solver available. Non-iterative approximate Riemann solvers can relieve these drawbacks of exact Riemann solvers. We present here two approximate Riemann solvers used in this thesis: the HLLC approximate Riemann solver and Roe solver.

\section{HLLC Riemann solver}
The HLLC solver is a 3-wave approximate Riemann solver proposed by \citet{toro1994restoration}. In this work, we adopt the formulation of the HLLC solver proposed by \citet{luo2004computation} for multi-material, underwater explosions in their ALE scheme. This Riemann solver has the properties of being positivity preserving for scalar quantities, entropy satisfying and to exact preserve isolated contacts.

Equation (\ref{eq:RP_solver_HLLC_u}) and (\ref{eq:RP_solver_HLLC_pu}) are the approximate solution to the local Riemann problem, written in term of $p$ and $pu$ as functions of local coordinate $q$.
\begin{equation}
p \left( q \right) =  \begin{cases} 
      p_L & if \  S_L \Delta t> q \\
      \frac{S_M}{S_L - S_M}\left [ (S_L - \hat{u}_L) M_L + (\hat{p}- p_L) \right] + \hat{p} & if \  S_L \Delta t \leq q \leq S_M \Delta t \\
      \frac{S_M}{S_R - S_M}\left [ (S_R - \hat{u}_R) M_R + (\hat{p}- p_R) \right] + \hat{p} & if \  S_M \Delta t \leq q \leq S_R \Delta t \\
      p_R & if \  S_R \Delta t < q
\end{cases}
\label{eq:RP_solver_HLLC_u}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
(pu) \left( q \right)  =  \begin{cases} 
      p_L u_L& if \  S_L \Delta t > q \\
      \frac{S_M}{S_L - S_M}\left [ (S_L - \hat{u}_L) E_L + (\hat{p} S_M - p_L \hat{u}_L) \right] + (S_M - \hat{u}_{LR}) \hat{p} & if \  S_L \Delta t \leq q \leq S_M \Delta t \\
      \frac{S_M}{S_R - S_M}\left [ (S_R - \hat{u}_R) E_R + (\hat{p} S_M- p_R \hat{u}_R) \right] + (S_M + \hat{u}_{LR}) \hat{p} & if \ S_M \Delta t \leq q \leq S_R \Delta t\\
      p_R u_R & if \  S_R \Delta t < q
\end{cases}
\label{eq:RP_solver_HLLC_pu}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{u}_{LR}$ is the interface velocity and is taken as the Roe-averaged velocity on either side of the interface \citep{cheng2007high}. The quantities of $\hat{u}_R$ and $\hat{u}_L$ are velocities relative to the interface velocity.
\begin{equation}
\hat{p}= \rho_L (\hat{u}_L - S_L) (\hat{u}_L - S_M) + p_L
\end{equation}
Formulation to approximate the signal speeds $S_M$, $S_L$ and $S_R$ is given by Eq. (\ref{eq:RP-solver-HLLC-SM}) to (\ref{eq:RP-solver-HLLC-SR}).
\begin{eqnarray}
S_M= \frac{\rho_R \hat{u}_R (S_R - \hat{u}_R) - \rho_L \hat{u}_L (S_L - \hat{u}_L) + p_L - p_R}{\rho_R (S_R - \hat{u}_R) - \rho_L (S_L - \hat{u}_L)} \label{eq:RP-solver-HLLC-SM} \\
S_L = min (\hat{u}_L - c_L, -c_{LR}) \label{eq:RP-solver-HLLC-SL} \\
S_R = max (\hat{u}_R - c_R, c_{LR}) \label{eq:RP-solver-HLLC-SR}
\end{eqnarray}
where $c_{LR}$ is the relevant Roe averaged sound speed \citep{cheng2007high}. 

\section{Roe Riemann solver}
Besides HLLC, another 2-wave approximate Riemann solver, the Roe Riemann solver \citep{roe1981approximate}, is also adopted in GSPH.
Roe Riemann solver is proposed by \citet{roe1981approximate} to linearize the Euler equations and approxiamate the solution of non-linear system by a system of linear equations. The characteristic decomposition of the linearized Lagrangian flux and Jacobia matrices are used to write the flux. \citet{rider1994review} proposed an algebraic averaging of the Lagrangian variables, which is adopted in this work. Since Roe solver is only used in GSPH. We directly provide here the resulting starred values of the pressure and velocity \citep{puri2014approximate}: 
\begin{eqnarray}
u^{\ast} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ u_L + u_R - \frac{1}{C_{LR}} (p_R - p_L) \right] \label{eq:RP-solver-ROE-u} \\
p^{\ast} = \frac{1}{2}\left[ p_L + p_R - C_{LR} (u_R - u_L) \right] \label{eq:RP-solver-ROE-p}
\end{eqnarray}
Where $C_{LR}$ is the averaged Lagarangian sound speed at the interface.
\begin{equation}
C_{LR} = \sqrt{\gamma p_{LR} \rho_{LR}}
\end{equation}
