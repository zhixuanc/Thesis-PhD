The effect of artificial viscosity is illustrated through comparison. Artificial viscosity coefficients are chosen to always satisfy: $\beta =2\alpha $ in all SPH tests. The last four figures are zoomed views. Almost no fluctuation is observed when $\alpha =1$ and $\alpha =2$, illustrating that numerical fluctuation is completely suppressed if artificial viscosity is large enough. For density distribution obtained by RSPH, the fluctuations are more obvious in the area away from shock than those calculated by SPH with $\alpha =0.2$, implying that RSPH introduces smaller artificial viscosity than SPH with $\alpha =0.2$ in the area far away from shock. However, fluctuations around shock is much more obvious for SPH with $\alpha =0.2$ than RSPH, implying that RSPH introduces larger artificial viscosity than ``$\alpha =0.2$" around shock. To summarize, the equivalent artificial viscosity in RSPH is adaptive. Similar conclusion can be drew from zoomed view of velocity. The third zoomed view shows different degrees of smearing at the shock. The larger the artificial viscosity, the less sharp the solution at the shock. Since ``$\alpha =0.2$" is sharper than ``RSPH" at the shock, ``$\alpha =0.2$" introduces less dissipation at the shock, which is consistent with information implied by zoomed view of density and velocity. SPH with $\alpha =1.0$ and $\alpha =2.0$ introduces more dissipation than ``RSPH" in the area around the shock. The last zoomed view shows pressure around the contact discontinuity.
