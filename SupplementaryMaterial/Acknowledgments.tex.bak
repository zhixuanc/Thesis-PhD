I would like to express sincere gratitude to my thesis advisor, Professor Abani K. Patra, for his guidance, solid support, encouragement, and constant proposal of challenging new ideas. I am grateful to him for all trainings that I got in his group and the academic freedom while doing research. The opportunities I had during my thesis work to attend international meetings and conferences and interact with other researchers are deeply appreciated, too.
I also express my appreciation to all the other members of my supervisory committee, Professor E. Bruce Pitman, Professor Marcus Bursik, and Professor Paul Bauman. In particular, the advice
and lecture-style instructions from Professor E. Bruce Pitman has been of great help in my work on model establishment, developing and implementing new SPH schemes, including GSPH and RSPH. Discussions with Professor Marcus Bursik regarding the necessity of developing a new plume model, the volcanic model simplification and potential implementations of the model are greatly helpful and appreciated. I would also like to take the chance to thanks him for his availability and his help to keep me on track. Advice and encouragement from Professor Bauman are also greatly appreciated.

I am grateful to collaborators of Professor Patra as well. Particularly, Dr. Jones, helped me in many technical issues that I had at the software development stage and implementation stage. I always got quick, patient and professional response from him even for small technical questions. Great appreciation goes to him. Advice and help from Dinesh, Ramona, Hossein and Topher made it easier for me to get start in the lab. I have been discussing and shearing knowledge and skills with Ali, Prashant, Qingyuan Yang, Abishek and Renette, which were pleasant learning experience and helpful to this thesis. Data shared by peers are indispensable for making progress during this thesis work, great appreciation goes to them: Suzuki Yujiro, Tomaso Esposti Ongaro, Antonio Costa and Matteo Cerminara.
 
Finally, I express my deep gratitude to my family for their love and solid support.
