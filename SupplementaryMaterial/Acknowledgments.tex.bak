% Place acknowledgments below.
I would like to express sincere gratitude to my thesis advisor, Professor Abani K. Patra, for his
guidance, forgiveness, encouragement, and constant proposal of challenging new ideas. I am grateful
to him for his continuous support on the research. The opportunities I had during my thesis work to attend international meetings and conferences and interact with other researchers are deeply appreciated, too.
I also express my appreciation to all the other members of my supervisory committee, Professor E. Bruce Pitman, Professor Marcus Bursik, and Professor Paul Bauman. In particular, the advice
and lecture-style instructions from Professor E. Bruce Pitman has been of great help in my work on model establishment, developing and implementing new SPH schemes, such as GSPH and RSPH. Discussions with Professor Marcus Bursik regarding the necessity of developing a new plume model, the volcanic model simplification and potential implementations of the model are greatly helpful and appreciated. I would also like to take the chance to thanks him for his adivices regarding my career plan. Advice and encouragement from Professor Bauman are also helpful and greatly appreciated.

I am grateful to collaborators and other students of Professor Patra as well. Particularly, Dr. Jones, helped me in many technical issues that I had at the software development stage and implementation stage. I always got quick, patient and professional response from him even for small technical questions. Great appreciation goes to him. Advice and help from Dinesh, Ramona and Hossein made it easier for me to get start in the lab. I have been discussing and shearing knowledge and skills with Ali, Prashant, Qingyuan Yang, Abishek and Renette, which were great learning experience and helpful to this thesis. 
 
Finally, I express my deep gratitude to my family for their solid support.
